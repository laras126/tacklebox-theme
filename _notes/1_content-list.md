Make a comprehensive list of your content here. Process via Stephen Hay's [Responsive Design Workflow](http://responsivedesignworkflow.com/). I've included an example, but adjust to fit your needs.

**NOTE:** Throw these guidelines into a Google Doc and have you or your client start writing content immediately. Good stuff [here](http://alistapart.com/blog/post/content-first-design).
